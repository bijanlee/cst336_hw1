			<p>Android application development, like iOS development, is a subset of smartphone app development.
			In this overview, we will discuss native Android App development with Android Studio and Java, not
			cross-platform solutions such as Cordova or Xamarin. Android development is done inside of Android
			Studio which was developeed by Google on top of the Intellij IDE and designed specifically for the
