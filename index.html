			<p>Software application development is a blanket term covering many different type of applications
			as well as different types of technologies used to develop the applications. There are many fundamental
			tenants of software development that are common among all of the types of app development. </p>
			
			<h2>Commonalities</h2>
			<p>For example, almost every single Software Developer is working inside of some sort of IDE, or, Integrated Development
			Environment. IDE's offer the developer a plethora of tools and resources such as debugging, source control
			integration with git, intellisense, and scaffolding. All of these resources help streamline the application
			development process.
