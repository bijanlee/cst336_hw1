			<p>iOS application development, like Android development, is a subset of smartphone app development.
			In this overview, we will discuss native iOS App development with Xcode, Swift, and Objective-C, not
			cross-platform solutions such as Cordova or Xamarin. All native iOS development must be done on an
			apple device that is running Xcode, Apple's IDE. All builds need to be run inside of Xcode. While there
			are some hacks to be able to run Xcode through an emulator, you will not be able to release an iOS app
			to the app store without a Mac. iOS applications use a storyboard for its layouts, and either Swift or
			Objective-C for handling the application logic.
