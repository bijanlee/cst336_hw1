			<p>Web Application development is a very broad topic, and web development can involve a plethora
			of different technologies involved. At a basic level, Web Development is done utilizing HTML and
			CSS. HTML is a mark up language. Css is a style sheet that describes the presentation of any document
			created using HTML. Going deeper, web applications all fundamentally follow the client/server pattern.
			The client is the user navigating the internet. The server is a computer that runs and waits for any
			requests on its sockets from a client. It then returns a response to the client's request, which often
			is just serving an HTML page to be rendered in the client's browser. Communication between the client and
			server is done using HTTP, or, Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Some of the most common Web Development
			frameworks include ASP.Net, Angular, and React.
